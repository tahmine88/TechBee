# Implementing AI-driven Techniques for Monitoring of Bee activities in Hives

## Abstract
In light of the significant decline in honey bee populations worldwide, our research aims to enhance bee conservation efforts through advanced artificial intelligence techniques. 
We have developed a deep learning model designed to monitor bees within hives effectively. 
This model is adept at identifying bees infected with Varroa mites and detecting various bee activities, which are critical for managing bee health and supporting biodiversity. 
Our work contributes to the sustainable development of ecosystems, improved agricultural productivity, and the advancement of the honey industry.
